start a package.json file by using "npm init"
in order to save a dependency to package.json, use the --save when installing with npm. for example "npm install express --save" will save the latest version of express to package.json
we used mlab.com to create a mongodb using aws
npm install" will search for a package.json folder within the directory that you're in
"npm install -g nodemon" is useful so that typing "nodemon" instead of "node server" will run the server but also detect changes
"npm install -g bower" is useful as a front end package manager
we want to create a seperate service folder that will contain files that allow us to comunicate with the API
  we does this so that we don't have to write the same code on each component
to add functionality, first add function is task.component.ts, then task.service.ts (make that hook to a function in tasks.js)
