<a name="What-is-this"><h1>What Is This</h1></a>
  <p>This is a simple tasklist written using the MEAN (mongodb, express, angular, and nodejs) stack. Mostly this is a project for learning the stack</p>

<a name="Prerequisites"><h1>Prerequisites</h1></a>
* Download and install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Download and install [Bower](https://bower.io/) (Downloading bower requires nodejs first)
* (Windows only!) A shell is recommended to run the program so the [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is very useful

<a name="Quick-Start"><h1>Quick Start</h1></a>
